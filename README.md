This is the source code for my portfolio website!  



Here, you can see how I built each aspect of my portfolio website.  I challenged myself to not use a UI framework (like Chakra UI) for this portfolio website, opting to style everything through basic HTML elements and SCSS modules.  This was my firts major project that used SCSS - I thought it was fantastic.  

The live version of this project is hosted in a Docker container on a DigitalOcean Droplet.

There you have it!  Let the identity theft commence ðŸ¥³
